    //Memory Assignment in a program:
    //-------------------------------
    //Code => Text segment.
    //Static/global Variables => Data Segment(intialized variable), BSS(Blocks Started For Symbols) Segment (uninitialized).
    //Stack => list of all the storage(variable) of functions.
    //LIFO => Last In First Out means first we will recieve whch we store in last. Stack runs according to LIFO.
    //Stack Overflow => When stack space gets exhausted for some bad reason, this situation is known as stack overflow.
    //Heap => it increases when we do dynamic memory location. It is used to create variable sized array and also delete memory.
    //In heap we create a memory pointer to point to memory blocks in the heap.
